Initially designed as a bandaid fix for iPhoneX development in Unity.

## Getting Started

Drop the folder into your project's Assets/ folder. Select the "Viewport Mask" prefab from the Prefabs/ folder and drop it anywhere in your scene.

### Prerequisites

Be sure to switch your project into iOS in the build settings and add 2 custom resolutions for iPhone X. For landscape, use 2436x1125 and for portrait use 1125x2436.
